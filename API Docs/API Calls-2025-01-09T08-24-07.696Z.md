                                            # API Calls


                                            The API Key is associated with the [Agent Key user](setupdashboardusers.htm), permissions and assigned [Client Groups](client_groups.htm). If the Agent Key user has been assigned to a Client Group that contains either no Clients or a subset of Clients, API calls made using the generated API Key can only return data associated with the Clients in the assigned Client Group.
        Where security requires that the Agent Key user access to Client information within N-sight RMM must be restricted, we recommend that the [Agent Key  Access is revoked](disable_pak.htm). 


                                            When you query our Data Extraction API, you use API Calls to gather specific types of data. Each API Call has a unique service name and can have required and optional parameters.

                                            To see the API Calls and their information, see the following API Call categories:

                                            **API Call Frequency** — Each API call uses system resources when querying and returning data. To avoid performance issues, do not send automated API calls  using a frequency less than 90 seconds. We may contact you if we detect API activity that negatively impacts system performance.


                                            For API Calls you can use the [Describe parameter](describe.htm) to return a description of the call, its parameters, and an output example.


                                            If valid parameters are not used in an API query, [Error Messages ](error_messages_.htm)are returned.


                                             


                                            Depending on the section and requirements, the API's page may include an **Example Associated Service Calls**.This section provides examples of the additional API calls needed to populate the required information in that page's main call. For example, in **list_sites** it includes the call to return the required **ClientID**.
